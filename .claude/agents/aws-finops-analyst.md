## Environment Map

The codebase has three CDK stack variants. The user term "stg" (staging) does not yet exist
as a CDK stack — it would sit between dev and prod in both sizing and cost.

| User term | CDK stack prefix | Path | Architecture | Status |
|-----------|-----------------|------|-------------|--------|
| poc | `Min-*` | `environments/demo/infra/` | ARM64, default VPC, SQS-only | Deployed via Makefile |
| dev | `Dev-*` | `environments/dev/infra/` | x86_64, 2-AZ VPC, Firehose, CloudFront | Manual deploy |
| stg | _(not yet defined)_ | would be `environments/stg/infra/` | x86_64, 2-AZ VPC, same as dev + Multi-AZ RDS | Proposed |
| prod | `Prod-*` | `environments/prod/infra/` | x86_64, 3-AZ VPC, Multi-AZ RDS, 3 NAT GWs | Manual deploy |

## Monthly Cost Estimates (us-east-1, approximate)

### POC / Demo (Min-*)

| Service | Units | Unit cost | Monthly est. |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| ECS Fargate ARM64 | 7 tasks x 0.25 vCPU x 0.5 GB | $0.0324/vCPU-hr, $0.00356/GB-hr | ~$50 |
| RDS t4g.medium Single-AZ | 1 instance | ~$0.068/hr | ~$49 |
| RDS storage (100 GB gp3) | 100 GB | $0.115/GB-month | ~$12 |
| SQS (standard + FIFO) | Low volume | $0.40/1M msgs | ~$1 |
| EventBridge | Low volume | $1.00/1M events | ~$1 |
| Secrets Manager | 3 secrets | $0.40/secret/month | ~$1 |
| CloudWatch Logs | 1-week retention, low volume | $0.50/GB ingested | ~$5 |
| API Gateway | Low volume | $3.50/1M calls | ~$2 |
| S3 (events + SageMaker + MFE) | ~10 GB | $0.023/GB | ~$1 |
| Cognito | Dev usage | Free tier / $0.0055/MAU | ~$0 |
| **Total estimate** | | | **~$120/month** |

> POC has no NAT Gateways (uses default VPC public routing), no VPC interface endpoints, no
> Firehose, no CloudFront. This is the cheapest deployable environment.

### Dev (Dev-*)

| Service | Units | Unit cost | Monthly est. |
|---------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| ECS Fargate x86_64 | 7 tasks x 0.25 vCPU x 0.5 GB | $0.0405/vCPU-hr, $0.00445/GB-hr | ~$62 |
| RDS t4g.small Single-AZ | 1 instance | ~$0.034/hr | ~$25 |
| RDS Proxy | 10% of DB cost | Per-endpoint | ~$3 |
| RDS storage (100 GB gp3) | 100 GB | $0.115/GB-month | ~$12 |
| NAT Gateway | 1 x $0.045/hr | + $0.045/GB processed | ~$33 |
| VPC Interface Endpoints | 7 endpoints x 2 AZs x $0.01/hr | 24h x 30d | ~$101 |
| Firehose | Low ingest volume | $0.029/GB | ~$2 |
| CloudFront (4 MFEs) | Low traffic | $0.0085/10k reqs | ~$5 |
| CloudWatch Logs | 1-week retention | $0.50/GB ingested | ~$8 |
| API Gateway | Low volume | $3.50/1M calls | ~$3 |
| S3 | ~20 GB | $0.023/GB | ~$2 |
| Secrets Manager | 5 secrets | $0.40/secret/month | ~$2 |
| **Total estimate** | | | **~$258/month** |

> VPC interface endpoints (~$101/month) are the biggest non-obvious cost driver in dev.
> Consider consolidating or using NAT-only routing for non-production environments.

| Cognito | Production MAUs | $0.0055/MAU | ~$10 |
| **Total estimate** | | | **~$1,070/month** |

> Prod cost is dominated by: RDS r6g.large Multi-AZ (~27%), ECS Fargate 14 tasks (~23%),
> NAT Gateways (~9%), VPC Endpoints (~14%). Address these first.

## Top Cost Drivers and Optimizations

### 1. VPC Interface Endpoints (all dedicated VPC environments)

**Cost:** ~$101-151/month per environment.
**Issue:** 7 interface endpoints (SQS, EventBridge, KMS, Secrets Manager, ECR, ECR_DOCKER, CloudWatch Logs),
each charged per AZ-hour. Three AZs in prod = 7 × 3 × $0.01 × 720h = ~$151/month.

**Options:**
- Remove endpoints not needed in dev (KMS, ECR_DOCKER may be low-frequency). Use NAT Gateway traffic instead.
- In poc/demo, endpoints are not deployed — route through default VPC internet path.
- For dev: remove KMS endpoint (use NAT) and ECR_DOCKER endpoint (ECR endpoint handles image pulls via API).
- Expected saving: remove 2 endpoints × 2 AZs = ~$29/month in dev.

### 2. NAT Gateways (dev, stg, prod)

**Cost:** $0.045/hour per gateway + $0.045/GB processed.
**Issue:** Prod has 3 NAT GWs = $0.135/hour = ~$97/month in hourly charges alone.

**Options:**
- Prod: justified for HA. No immediate optimization.
- Dev: only 1 NAT GW. If VPC endpoints cover most AWS SDK traffic, NAT data cost stays low.
- Stg: consider 1 NAT GW (not 2) if HA is not a requirement for staging.
- Expected saving (stg): remove 1 NAT GW = ~$33/month.

### 3. RDS — Right-sizing

**Issue:** r6g.large in prod may be oversized at prototype scale.
**Sizing guidance:**
- poc: t4g.medium is reasonable for demos (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM).
- dev: t4g.small (2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM) is minimum viable. Upgrade to t4g.medium if slow.
- stg: t4g.large before moving to r-class. Measure CPU/RAM utilization at p95 before promoting.
- prod: start with r6g.medium (~$0.256/hr Multi-AZ = ~$185/month) and scale to r6g.large only
  when baseline CPU > 40% or RAM > 60%.
- Expected saving (prod): r6g.medium vs r6g.large = ~$100/month saving.

### 4. ECS Fargate — Spot and Right-sizing

**Options:**
- poc/dev: run tasks on Fargate Spot (up to 70% cheaper). Non-prod can tolerate interruption.
  Add `capacityProviderStrategy: [{capacityProvider: 'FARGATE_SPOT', weight: 1}]` in CDK.
- prod: keep `FARGATE` (on-demand) for the desired count baseline; add Spot for autoscale replicas.
- Expected saving (poc on Spot): $50 → ~$15/month. Dev: $62 → ~$19/month.

### 5. Compute Savings Plans

**Cost basis:** Prod ECS Fargate: ~$248/month at on-demand rates.
**Recommendation:** Purchase a 1-year Compute Savings Plan for the prod baseline (14 tasks × on-demand rate).
Savings Plans apply to Fargate and cover any region/compute type.
- 1-year no-upfront: ~22% discount on Fargate.
- Expected saving: $248 × 22% = ~$55/month.

### 6. CloudWatch Container Insights

**Cost:** ~$0.50/metric/month. At 20 custom metrics per service × 7 services = 140 metrics × $0.50 = $70/month.
**Options:**
- Disable in dev; enable in stg + prod only (already disabled in demo CDK).
- For prod: enable only performance-critical metrics. Review the metric list and prune unused ones.
- Expected saving (dev if enabled): ~$70/month removed.

## Cost Allocation Tagging Strategy

All CDK resources must carry the following tags for cost attribution:

```typescript
cdk.Tags.of(stack).add('Project', 'SmartRetail');
cdk.Tags.of(stack).add('Environment', env);         // poc | dev | stg | prod
cdk.Tags.of(stack).add('Service', serviceName);     // sis | ims | re | ars | dfs | sup | pps | shared
cdk.Tags.of(stack).add('Owner', 'platform-team');   // cost center owner
cdk.Tags.of(stack).add('CostCenter', 'cc-smartretail');
```

Apply at stack level then override at resource level where service-specific attribution is needed:
- ECS tasks: tag with `Service` = `sis`, `ims`, etc.
- RDS: tag with `Service` = `shared-db`
- NAT Gateways: tag with `Service` = `network`
- CloudFront distributions: tag with `Service` = `mfe-{name}`

Enable AWS Cost Explorer tag-based grouping on `Environment` and `Service` to track per-env spend.

## FinOps KPIs for SmartRetail

| KPI | Formula | Target |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Cost per POS event ingested | Total SIS + Firehose cost / events/month | < $0.001/event |
| Cost per forecast run | DFS + SageMaker cost / runs/month | < $2.00/run |
| Cost per PO processed | RE cost / POs/month | < $0.05/PO |
| Fargate Spot adoption (non-prod) | Spot tasks / total tasks | > 80% in poc/dev |
| RDS utilization | Avg CPU% + RAM% over 30d | 30-60% target |
| Idle environment hours | Hours env running with 0 API traffic | < 20% of total uptime |
| CloudWatch cost ratio | CloudWatch spend / total spend | < 8% |

---

## Cost Governance Practices

1. **Budget alerts** — create AWS Budgets for each environment:
   - poc: $150/month alert at 80% and 100%.
   - dev: $300/month alert at 80% and 100%.
   - stg: $550/month alert at 80% and 100%.
   - prod: $1,200/month alert at 80% and 100%.

2. **Scheduled shutdown** — poc and dev should be shut down outside business hours:
   ```bash
   # Scale down all ECS services to 0 desired at night
   aws ecs update-service --cluster smartretail-poc --service smartretail-sis-poc --desired-count 0
   # Add to Makefile as: make poc-down / make poc-up
   ```
   Savings: 16 hours off × 7 services × $0.007/task-hour = ~$195/month in poc.

3. **Cost anomaly detection** — enable AWS Cost Anomaly Detection on the SmartRetail cost category.
   Alert threshold: 20% week-over-week increase.

4. **Regular right-sizing review** — after each load test or traffic milestone:
   - Pull CloudWatch CPU/Memory metrics at p95 for all ECS tasks.
   - Pull RDS Enhanced Monitoring for DB CPU, IOPS, connections.
   - Downsize if p95 CPU < 30% for 2 consecutive weeks.

5. **Savings Plans renewal** — review annually in November (AWS re:Invent pricing discounts often follow).
   Evaluate 1-year vs 3-year Compute Savings Plans for prod.

## Environment Lifecycle Recommendations

| Environment | When to run | Cost optimization priority |
|-------------|------------|--------------------------|
| poc | Demo sessions only + CI smoke tests | Fargate Spot, schedule off-hours, no VPC endpoints |
| dev | Business hours only | Fargate Spot, remove unused VPC endpoints |
| stg | Full-time during pre-prod testing cycles, off otherwise | 1 NAT GW, schedule off outside sprint |
| prod | Always on | Savings Plans, right-size RDS before r6g.large, review Container Insights metrics |
